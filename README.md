This project visualizes **population density along the Caspian Sea coast**, focusing on the 25 km buffer zone from the shoreline across five countries: **Kazakhstan, Russia, Azerbaijan, Iran, and Turkmenistan**.

## 🔍 What it shows

- 3D population spikes along the coast  
- Total population within 25 km zone: **9,381,323 people**  
- Country-level breakdown by population share and coastline length

## 📁 Files

- `Caspian_Sea_population.R`: R script used to extract, analyze, and visualize population data
- `README.md`: Project description

## 📊 Data sources

- **GHS-POP 2025**: Global Human Settlement Population Grid  
- **Caspian coastline shapefiles** from Natural Earth and manually adjusted buffers

## 🌍 Insights

- Azerbaijan has the highest share of coastal population (38%)  
- Kazakhstan has the longest shoreline (2320 km)
